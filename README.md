# Puff Painter

This is a very fun little drawing app that lets you draw with puffy circles that change size depending on how fast your mouse is moving. The circles stacking on top of each other gives it a 3D effect. My brother Jared helped me out a lot with this, especially with the math to make gradient circles, because I didn't know trig very well at the time.
